# Pokemon Rainbow Quartz

This rom hack is an overhaul of Crystal for personal use.
Many balance decisions were made with the goal of pretending
like this was the last game Pokemon would ever have.

Manny Pokemon who would later get new evolutions will now have their current evolutions compensate in their power.

Something like a single stage Pokemon should therefore, not be hovering around the 300-400 range, but more so a high 400-500 range. Unless it's a Legendary, then something more like 600-700 is in order. The final Stage of any Pokemon should be more high 400s, mid 500s as well.

With the higher power level of such evolutions, later trainers will be scaled in accomodation for that. Levels will curve higher than before.

As such, Kanto will be seen as a late late game, designed to be much harder. Red and Blue will be the only trainers with level 100 Pokemon, and all other trainers in Kanto will be scaled accordingly as well. Johto will have its upper level be around 50-60.

Also, many learnsets will be adjusted so that Pokemon can actually learn useful moves!
