        - 390 BST -> 420 BST
    - Dunsparce
        - 70 ATK -> 150 ATK
        - 70 DEF -> 65 DEF
        - 65 SAT -> 120 SAT
        - 45 SPD -> 5 SPD
        - 415 BST ->  505 BST
    - Togetic
        - 55 HP -> 125 HP
        - 85 DEF -> 90 DEF
        - 80 SAT -> 110 SAT
        - 405 BST -> 510 BST
    - Unown
        - 48 HP -> 60 HP
        - 72 ATK -> 90 ATK

        - 60 SAT -> 80 SAT
        - 80 SDF -> 70 SDF
        - 405 BST -> 420
    - Bellossom
        - 80 ATK -> 50 ATK
        - 90 SAT -> 80 SAT
        - 50 SPD -> 90 SPD
    - Stantler
        - 73 HP -> 75 HP
        - 95 ATK -> 125 ATK
        - 62 DEF -> 65 DEF
        - 85 SAT -> 115 SAT
        - 465 BST -> 530 BST
    - Sneasel
        - 95 ATK -> 125 ATK
        - 115 SPD -> 125 SPD
        - 430 BST -> 470 BST
    - Aipom
        - 70 ATK -> 100 ATK
        - 85 SPD -> 105 SPD
        - 360 BST -> 410 BST
    - Ditto
        - 48 -> 60 (All Stats except HP)
        - 48 HP -> 100 HP
        - 288 BST -> 400 BST
        - Note: The only stats that really matter to Ditto are the HP and the Speed, since they gain the stats of the Pokemon they transform into anyway.
    - Yanma
        - 65 ATK -> 95 ATK
        - 95 SPD -> 150 SPD
        - 75 SAT -> 55 SAT
        - 390 BST -> 455 BST
    - Beedrill
        - 80 ATK -> 155 ATK
        - 45 SAT -> 15 SAT
        - 75 SPD -> 125 SPD
        - 385 BST -> 480 BST
    - Noctowl
        - 76 SAT -> 110 SAT
        - 96 SDF -> 100 SDF
        - 442 BST -> 480 BST
    - Murkrow
        - 85 ATK -> 95 ATK
        - 42 DEF -> 50 SDF
        - 85 SAT -> 95 SAT
        - 42 SDF -> 50 SDF
        - 91 SPD -> 110 SPD
        - 405 BST -> 460 BST
    - Goldeen
        - 67 ATK -> 75 ATk
        - 60 DEF -> 65 DEF
        - 35 SAT -> 100 SAT
        - 60 SDF -> 65 SDF
        - 63 SPD -> 100 SPD
        - 320 BST -> 450 BST
    - Seaking
        - 80 HP -> 100 HP
        - 92 ATK -> 100 ATK
        - 65 DEF -> 80 DEF
        - 65 SAT -> 25 SAT
        - 68 SPD -> 65 SPD
        - Note: I wanted to try something with the Goldeen line since they're basically just a lamer Magikarp. I made it so both of them have the same BST, but Golden is more of a fast, mixed attacker, while Seaking is a bulky physical attacker.
    - Delibird
        - 45 HP -> 125 HP
        - 45 DEF -> 95 DEF
        - 45 SDF -> 95 SDF
        - 330 BST -> 510 BST
        - Note: Delibird is terrible, and I wanted to give it a use case that would fit on theme with the design. So I decided to make it a bulky support Pokemon. In the future, I might also remove the Ice typing if it proves too detrimental.
    - Corsola
        - 85 DEF -> 105 DEF
        - 65 SAT -> 95 SAT
        - 85 SDF -> 105 SDF
        - 330 BST -> 400 BST
    - Xatu
        - 75 ATK -> 65 ATK
        - 70 SDF -> 100 SDF
        - 95 SAT -> 105 SAT
        - 470 BST -> 500 BST
    - Farfetch'd
        - 52 HP -> 55 HP
        - 65 ATK -> 105 ATK
        - 55 DEF -> 70 DEF
        - 58 SAT -> 68 SAT
        - 60 SPD -> 90 SPD
        - 352 BST -> 450 BST
    - Flareon
        - 65 SPD -> 110 SPD
        - 110 SDF -> 65 SDF
        - Note: many of flareon's issues stem from its low physical bulk and low speed, so this change aims to fix one of those issues while simultaneously trying to ignore the other one.
    - Octillery
        - 75 HP -> 105 HP
        - 105 ATK -> 25 ATK
        - 75 DEF -> 100 DEF
        - 105 SAT -> 125 SAT
        - 75 SDF -> 100 SDF
        - 45 SPD -> 25 SPD
        - Note: I really wanted to emphasize the fact that this was based off of a cannon/artillery, so making it a slow, bulky special attacker made sense. I also felt as its overall BST felt right for this kind of Pokemon, so I left it as is.
    - Lickitung
        - 90 HP -> 140 HP
        - 55 ATK -> 105 ATK
        - 385 BST -> 485 BST
    - Wigglytuff
        - 75 SAT -> 105 SAT
        - 45 DEF -> 60 DEF
        - 50 SDF -> 65 SDF
        - 425 BST -> 485 BST
        - Note: While it's not a perfect analog, I did kind of want Lickitung and Wigglytuff to slightly be counterparts to each other, with one being more physically oriented, and the other being specially oriented.
    - Fearow
        - 65 HP -> 95 HP
        - 90 ATK -> 110 ATK
        - 65 DEF -> 75 DEF
        - 61 SAT -> 60 SAT
        - 61 SDF -> 60 SDF
        - 100 SPD -> 80 SPD
        - 442 BST -> 480 BST
        - Note: since Dodrio is more of a Fast Sweeper, will now serve the role of a Bulky Wall-Breaker.
    - Pidgeot
        - 83 HP -> 95 HP
        - 80 ATK -> 79 ATK
        - 75 DEF -> 90 DEF
        - 70 SAT -> 40 SAT
        - 70 SDF -> 85 SDF
        - 469 BST -> 480 BST
        - Note: Pidgeot now falls under the Bulky Support Role.
    - Dodrio
        - 100 SPD -> 110 SPD
        - 470 BST -> 480 BST
        - Note: Dodrio, Pidgeot, and Fearow are all part of the Kantonian (regular) bird trio. I want to make them all have their own unique roles to play in a team. Also, they all will now have a BST of 480.
    - Sudowoodo
        - 70 HP -> 140 HP
        - 410 BST -> 480 BST
        - Note: I think it would be cool if Sudowoodo became like a Rock-type Wobbuffett.
